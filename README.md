# Create-Sample-json-From-MRF

👋 Hi there! Do you want to create sample JSON files from any MRF? 🤔 This is something I needed for a long time. I finally made it work as part of another project I did for a client. 🙌 I hope it can help some of you too. 😊

In this example, I create a new json file with 100 IN_NETWORK records. 📝 I like working with JSON samples when I write new SQL or Python scripts… or when I deal with new MRF files. 🐍 It’s so much easier when the original file is large and takes a long time to run. ⏳
